# Hash Table
---
## usage of collections.xxx() in py3
- leetcode 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
- Counter().keys() != Counter.elements(), the latter shows each appearance of an element in Counter
- Counters can be &'d
- defaultdict(list) can initialise hashMap[key]=[]
## design a suitable key
1. When the order of each element in the string/array doesn't matter, you can use the sorted string/array as the key.

2. If you only care about the offset of each value, usually the offset from the first value, you can use the offset as the key.

3. In a tree, you might want to directly use the TreeNode as key sometimes. But in most cases, the serialization of the subtree might be a better idea. (e.g. leetcode 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees)

4. In a matrix, you might want to use the row index or the column index as key.
5. In a Sudoku, you can combine the row index and the column index to identify which block this element belongs to.

6. Sometimes, in a matrix, you might want to aggregate the values in the same diagonal line.

## n Sum problem
- if a + b + c == 0, we can always take advantage of the fact: a + b = -c with HashMap, therefore reduce the time complexity down to O(len(nums)^(n-1))
- e.g.: leetcode 454. 4Sum II; leetcode 18. 4Sum; leetcode 1. Two Sum; leetcode 15 3Sum etc.
