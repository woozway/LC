# Array and String notes
---
## Common Strategy: 
for solving a lot of programming problem is to first solve a stripped down, simpler version of them and then think what needs to be changed to achieve the original goal.
1. leetcode **498. Diagonal Traverse**
   - solve the same direction traversal first
   - reverse the intermediate list
2. you might sometimes need to sort the array before using the two-pointer technique. And you might need a greedy thought to determine your movement strategy.
3. need to master method 3: Cyclic replacements in leetcode **189. Rotate Array**
